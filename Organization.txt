Stuff 100% necessary for a complete game (In addition to the "known bugs" section)



- Implement bad luck protection




Stuff I really should do but the game would still be complete otherwise



- Bad luck protection
- See if there's a more efficient / smoother looking way to make the rectangles 
- Look for a unity-native rectangle?

- Standardize scene sizes and locations 





Stuff I could leave out and would still consider the game complete



- Optimize collision (current method is fairly efficient but could be leagues better)
- Increase speed over time

- Different Gamemodes

- Different Difficulties (Easy, Medium, or Hard - Just changes the speed but could also change how fast the track changes - It's all just variables, so wouldn't be hard to do)

- Add powerups that slow down the track or make the track bigger (specifically seems really hard to implement - Would have to switch out all the textures probably) something like that
