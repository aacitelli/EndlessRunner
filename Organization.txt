Stuff 100% necessary for a complete game (In addition to the "known bugs" section)

- Finish menu screen 
- COLLISION (Will be weird, but long story short, I'll check that none of the triangle is touching white, not sure if that's easy but I'm hoping it is
- Implement bad luck protection


Stuff I really should do but the game would still be complete otherwise

- Bad luck protection
- See if there's a more efficient / smoother looking way to make the rectangles - Look for a unity-native rectangle?
- Standardize scene sizes and locations 


Stuff I could leave out and would still consider the game complete

- Increase speed over time
- Different Gamemodes
- Different Difficulties (Easy, Medium, or Hard - Just changes the speed but could also change how fast the track changes - It's all just variables, so wouldn't be hard to do)
- Add powerups that slow down the track or make the track bigger (specifically seems really hard to implement - Would have to switch out all the textures probably) something like that


Game-Breaking Bugs

- STILL HOLES IN THE PATHS - I NEED TO FIGURE OUT THE GENERATION SYSTEM AND THE BEST WAY TO DO IT (It's not "my way", that's for sure)


Non-Game-Breaking Bugs
