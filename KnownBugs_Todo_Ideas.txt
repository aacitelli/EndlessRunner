Planned / Todo

- Redo the texture on the player to be seen in front of the path, probably grey or with a white outline or something
- Make a menu and settings screen and all that (Involves switching scenes which isn't hard but I'd need to learn it)
- Make it so the path can't generate offscreen 
- See if there's a more efficient method for making the path rather than using a bunch of rectangle textures - Maybe see if there's a built-in "box" in Unity2D


Known Bugs

- The path segments all sort of "conglomerate" onto lines together, leading to spaced out lines. No clue why.
- Path goes really fast (This is intentional, and easy to fix, but I'm using it for testing which direction the generation goes)


Ideas 

- Different Gamemodes
- Different Difficulties (Easy, Medium, or Hard - Just changes 
- Add powerups that slow down the track or make the track bigger (specifically seems really hard to implement - Would have to switch out all the textures probably) something like that
