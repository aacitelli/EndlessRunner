Stuff 100% necessary for a complete game

- Make a menu and settings screen and all that (Involves switching scenes which isn't hard but I'd need to learn it)
- COLLISION (Will be weird, but long story short, I'll check that none of the triangle is touching white, not sure if that's easy but I'm hoping it is
- Implement bad luck protection


Stuff I really should do but the game would still be complete otherwise

- Bad luck protection
- See if there's a more efficient / smoother looking way to make the rectangles - Look for a unity-native rectangle?


Stuff I could leave out and would still consider the game complete

- Increase speed over time
- Different Gamemodes
- Different Difficulties (Easy, Medium, or Hard - Just changes the speed but could also change how fast the track changes - It's all just variables, so wouldn't be hard to do)
- Add powerups that slow down the track or make the track bigger (specifically seems really hard to implement - Would have to switch out all the textures probably) something like that


Known Bugs

- STILL HOLES IN THE PATHS - I NEED TO FIGURE OUT THE GENERATION SYSTEM AND THE BEST WAY TO DO IT (It's not "my way", that's for sure)
