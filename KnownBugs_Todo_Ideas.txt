Planned / Todo

- Make a menu and settings screen and all that (Involves switching scenes which isn't hard but I'd need to learn it)
- See if there's a more efficient method for making the path rather than using a bunch of rectangle textures - Maybe see if there's a built-in "box" in Unity2D
- COLLISION (Will be weird, but long story short, I'll check that none of the triangle is touching white, not sure if that's easy but I'm hoping it is
- Increase speed over time
- Fix 

Known Bugs

Ideas 

- Different Gamemodes
- Different Difficulties (Easy, Medium, or Hard - Just changes the speed but could also change how fast the track changes - It's all just variables, so wouldn't be hard to do)
- Add powerups that slow down the track or make the track bigger (specifically seems really hard to implement - Would have to switch out all the textures probably) something like that
